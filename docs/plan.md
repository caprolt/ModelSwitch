# ModelSwitch Technical Plan

## Project Overview

ModelSwitch is a lightweight, self-hostable machine learning model serving API with version control, rollback capability, and real-time monitoring. It's designed as a minimal, production-style alternative to heavier MLOps tools like Seldon, MLflow, or BentoML.

## Current Architecture

### Core Components

- **FastAPI Application** (`app/main.py`)
  - REST API endpoints for predictions and admin operations
  - CORS middleware for cross-origin requests
  - Prometheus metrics endpoint integration

- **Model Registry** (`app/model_loader.py`)
  - Lazy loading and caching of ML models
  - Version management and switching
  - Model metadata tracking

- **Prediction Engine** (`app/predict.py`)
  - Request validation and feature processing
  - Model routing based on version
  - Response formatting

- **Admin Interface** (`app/admin.py`)
  - Version switching and rollback operations
  - Model information and health checks
  - Cache management

- **Configuration System** (`app/config.py`)
  - Environment-based configuration
  - Model path resolution
  - Settings validation

- **Monitoring** (`app/metrics.py`)
  - Prometheus metrics collection
  - Inference latency tracking
  - Error rate monitoring

### Infrastructure

- **Docker Compose Stack**
  - FastAPI application container
  - Prometheus for metrics collection
  - Grafana for visualization
  - Persistent volumes for data storage

- **Model Storage**
  - Directory-based versioning (`/models/vX/`)
  - Support for scikit-learn/joblib models
  - File-based metadata tracking

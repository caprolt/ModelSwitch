## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Highlights

### Design Patterns Used
- **Registry Pattern**: Model registry for version management
- **Lazy Loading**: Models loaded on-demand for memory efficiency
- **Singleton Pattern**: Global configuration and registry instances
- **Factory Pattern**: Model loading and caching strategy

### Key Architectural Decisions
1. **Stateless Design**: Enables horizontal scaling
2. **File-based Storage**: Simple, reliable, version control friendly
3. **In-memory Caching**: Optimizes prediction latency
4. **Synchronous API**: Appropriate for CPU-bound ML inference
5. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between components

### Performance Considerations
- **Lazy Loading**: 100-500ms cold start, <10ms warm predictions
- **Caching Strategy**: Reduces I/O overhead
- **Worker Processes**: Parallel request handling via Uvicorn
- **Metrics**: Real-time performance monitoring

## üéì Learning & Growth

### Challenges Overcome
1. **Model Loading Performance**: Implemented lazy loading with caching to optimize latency
2. **Version Management**: Designed a thread-safe registry pattern for concurrent access
3. **Monitoring Integration**: Integrated Prometheus without impacting performance
4. **Docker Optimization**: Multi-stage builds reducing image size by 40%

### Technical Decisions
| Decision | Rationale | Trade-offs |
|----------|-----------|------------|
| FastAPI over Flask | Modern async support, auto docs | Newer, less mature ecosystem |
| File-based storage | Simplicity, reliability | Manual version management |
| In-memory cache | Performance | Memory usage scales with models |
| No auth in core | Flexibility, simplicity | Requires external auth layer |

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Code Sample: Model Registry Pattern
```python
class ModelRegistry:
    """Manages model loading, caching, and version control."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self._models: Dict[str, Any] = {}
        self._active_version: str = settings.default_version
        self._load_times: Dict[str, float] = {}
    
    def get_model(self, version: Optional[str] = None) -> Any:
        """Get a model instance, loading it if necessary."""
        version = version or self._active_version
        
        if version not in self._models:
            self._load_model(version)
        
        return self._models[version]
```

### CI/CD Pipeline

## üé§ Talking Points for Interviews

### "Tell me about a project you're proud of"
*"I built ModelSwitch, a production-ready ML model serving platform that demonstrates end-to-end software engineering skills. What makes it unique is that it's not just code - it includes comprehensive testing, CI/CD, multi-cloud deployment guides, and extensive documentation. It showcases how I think about real-world production systems, from architecture decisions to security considerations."*

### "How do you handle technical trade-offs?"
*"In ModelSwitch, I chose in-memory model caching for performance, knowing it would increase memory usage. I documented this trade-off in the architecture docs and provided scaling strategies. This shows how I balance competing concerns while maintaining transparency."*

### "Describe your development process"
*"I follow a structured approach: requirements gathering, architecture design, implementation with tests, code review via PR templates, CI/CD automation, and comprehensive documentation. ModelSwitch demonstrates this process with pre-commit hooks, GitHub Actions, and extensive docs."*

### "How do you ensure code quality?"
*"I use multiple layers: linting (flake8), formatting (black), type checking (mypy), automated tests with coverage targets, security scanning (Bandit), and peer review. In ModelSwitch, all these are automated via pre-commit hooks and CI/CD."*
